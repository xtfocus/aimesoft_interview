# `transformers` library

Not to be mistaken with [[1708742710-KDYY|transformers the architecture]].

The transformers Python library is a versatile toolkit designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly those involving transformer-based models. Here are the key highlights:

1. Pretrained Models: The library offers an extensive collection of pretrained models across various domains, including text, vision, and audio. These models serve as powerful starting points for NLP tasks and can be fine-tuned for specific applications.

2. Modality Agnostic: Beyond text, transformers can handle other modalities, such as combining text and images for tasks like table question answering or visual question answering.

3. Ease of Use: Developers can easily download pretrained models, fine-tune them on custom datasets, and share their work with the community via the model hub. Each architecture module is modular and adaptable for research experiments.

4. Deep Learning Frameworks: The library supports three major deep learning frameworks: Jax, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Users can train models using one framework and deploy them for inference using another.

5. Online Demos: Users can explore most models directly through online demos, experimenting with tasks like masked word completion (using BERT), named entity recognition (using Electra), and text generation (using GPT-2).
